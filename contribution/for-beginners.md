description: How to contribute to openVALIDATION?

# For beginners

### If you want to join openVALIDATION, then openVALIDATION wants you too!

Actually it doesn't matter if you can already program or not. Or if you are a computer expert or not. You are welcome here. There are many ways you can contribute to the project:

* You could run tests and report bugs
* You could write user tutorials
* Driving general publicity on social media
* Improve documentation
* Make suggestions for new features
* You could translate certain elements of the software. We want openVALIDATION to understand not only English and German, but also many other languages

#### But also as a developer there is a lot to do:

* You could add more generator templates like for C++, PHP, TypeScript, Go, Ruby etc.
* troubleshoot
* Work through existing issues
* Promote integration into various ecosystems, such as Angular, Vue, React, NodeRed, Zapier, openAPI, etc.
* and many other exciting tasks...

We want to radically change the way people write software tomorrow. We believe that the use of a natural language instead of a formal programming Language is one of the key elements. There is no question that this challenge is absolutely epic. So let's do it together!
